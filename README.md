This repository contains all data (model output) and code necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures for the sagebrush model comparison project. Results from this project can be found in the publication titled "Multi-model comparison highlights consistency in predicted effects of warming on a semi-arid shrub", available at https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13900.

Code that was used to process the climate data used to drive models is also included in the data_processing_code folder.

Cloning the entire repository is the easiest way to reproduce figures because it will maintain the original file structure. If you are just interested in the model output, this can be found in a more user-friendly format in the "Products" folder.
